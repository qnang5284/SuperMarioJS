# SuperMarioJS
Simple Super Mario game done in Javascript with kaboom.js


This is just following step-byt-step the tutorial on replit documentation at: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/build-mario-with-kaboom 

There's not really much to it, I'm just trying to learn some JavaScript and the kaboom.js library seemed like a good bit of fun.
