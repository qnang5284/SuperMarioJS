Simple Super Mario game done in Javascript with kaboom.js


This is just following step-byt-step the tutorial made by Ania Kub√≥w on her youtube channel (link: https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w).

There's not really much to it, I'm just trying to learn some JavaScript and the kaboom.js library seemed like a good bit of fun.
